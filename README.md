- [RIP Twitter API](https://github.com/ryanmurt/Twitter) - X's shutdown of their research API in 2023 was a death knell for social media research. By analyzing the 27,453 research studies that used X's API between 2006-2023 we illustrate what will be lost if the API continues to be closed to academic research.

# About Me
Finding actionable insights in large datasets is my passion. I am a data analyst and research methodologist, ready to deploy (or learn!) any skill necessary to find the answers my team needs. I excel at Python, SQL, Tableau, data visualization, R, statistics, and evidence synthesis. Once I commit to a problem, I work it from every angle, seeking out the help I need, innovating tools and approaches, and never giving up until it's solved. I'm currently conducting research on political bias in X's Community Notes at the Center for an Informed Public, and completing my Master of Library and Information Science at the University of Washington. Beyond technical expertise, my recent position as Lead Data Analyst at TrueMedia.org sharpened my ability to supervise teams, standardize data labeling processes, and operationalize workflows. In addition, as a public school music teacher for 14 years, I have a proven track record as a strong leader, an innovative problem-solver, an excellent communicator, and a committed teammate.
