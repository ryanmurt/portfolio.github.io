# Welcome to My Portfolio  
I am passionate about SQL, Python, and visualizations with Tableau.

## Featured Projects  
- [RIP Twitter API](https://github.com/ryanmurt/twitter) - X's shutdown of their research API in 2023 was a death knell for social media research. By analyzing the 27,453 research studies that used X's API between 2006-2023 we illustrate what will be lost if the API continues to be closed to academic research.

## About Me  
Finding actionable insights in large datasets is my passion. I am a data analyst and research methodologist, ready to deploy (or learn!) any skill necessary to find the answers my team needs. I excel at Python, SQL, Tableau, data visualization, R, statistics, and evidence synthesis. Once I commit to a problem, I work it from every angle, seeking out the help I need, innovating tools and approaches, and never giving up until it's solved. I hold a Masters in Information Science from the University of Washington. [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanmurtfeldt/)
