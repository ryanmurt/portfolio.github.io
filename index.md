# Welcome to My Portfolio  
I am passionate about SQL, Python, and visualizations with Tableau.

## Featured Projects  
- [RIP Twitter API](https://github.com/ryanmurt/twitter) - X's shutdown of their research API in 2023 was a death knell for social media research. By analyzing the 27,453 research studies that used X's API between 2006-2023 we illustrate what will be lost if the API continues to be closed to academic research.

## About Me  
I am passionate about uncovering patterns in data, telling meaningful stories, and helping organizations build better products and services that make a positive difference in the world. I recently worked as the Lead Data Analyst at Truemedia, an AI startup, where I used Python to analyze large datasets, built weekly reports on key trends, and collaborated across teams to improve decision-making and workflows. During my masters, I worked as a Graduate Researcher at the Center for an Informed Public, where I used tools like Tableau and matplotlib to create dashboards and reports that translated complex research into clear, actionable insights for non-technical audiences. I am currently looking for a data analyst role where I can continue learning and making an impact through data-driven work. [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanmurtfeldt/)
